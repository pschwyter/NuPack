# NuPack
Nulogy Code Exercise

The RepackageEstimate class accepts three arguments:
<ul>
  <li>base_cost: A cost calculated by another system based on how many products need to be repackaged (ie. '$2300.42')</li>
  <li>num_people: The number of people required to work on the job (ie. '4 people')</li>
  <li>category: The product category the job falls under (ie. 'Food')</li>
</ul>

Calling #estimate on an instance of RepackageEstimate returns a pricing estimate for the job.
